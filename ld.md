## Round Procedures

### Important Notes

- Saturday rounds are DOUBLE-flighted.
  - Because the Coin Flip is pre-set to occur a specific time in each Flight we cannot start B-flight early in Round 5.
  - Judges = If you do NOT have both A-flight debaters, but you do have both B-flight debaters, you can let the B-flight debaters go first
  - However: DO NOT MIX AND MATCH
    - A-flight debaters MUST debate each other
    - B-flight debaters MUST debate each other
  - Judges = ONCE the first flight is done - move immediately to the next flight
  - Students = A-Flight should go to the floor immediately once Round 5 is posted!
  - All kids should go to the floor (A-flight + B-flight) prior to Round Start and those not debating go back to the Student Lounge once the Round Starts
- Judges = Do NOT disclose your decision or provide oral critique - the decision and all comments go on the ballot.
- Judges = Do NOT confer with the other judges in the round.
- ALL = There is Wi-Fi - but please Do NOT stream music or video on the Wi-Fi or otherwise use it for personal activities. We need the Wi-Fi for rounds to run smoothly, ballots to be submitted, and the tournament to run on time!
- All = You will find 2 plugs in each cubicle. Please remember to bring a powerstrip to ensure everyone in the round can access power.

### How It Works

- Judges = once Pairings are posted, as soon as possible: (1) get to your room; and (2) access your ballot by hitting the “{{button}}” button (formerly known as “Start”) on the A-flight ballot immediately.
  - If you end up running the B-flight first - that’s ok. You can click {{button}} on the B-flight ballot and Tabroom can unstart A-flight for you. You can then click {{button}} on the A-flight ballot once you run that flight.
  - We want judges to press the {{button}} (formerly known as the "Start Button") on the A-flight ballot as soon as possible so we know you are here and we do not need to find a substitute!
- Judges = to be very clear: do not wait for the beginning of the A-flight debate to press the {{button}} (formerly known as the "Start Button") . Press {{button}} on the A-flight ballot the moment you are on your way.
  Reminder: competitors will forfeit their Round if they are not in the competition room 10 mins after the Round is posted to start.
- Judges - if you need a forfeit declared - Contact Tab!! You cannot declare the forfeit. Only the Tab Chair can declare a forfeit.

- Evidence Sharing = If you want to share evidence online, the Affirmative team should create a Room on <https://speechdrop.net/> as soon as they enter the room and share the SpeechDrop Room Number with everyone in the round
  The Room Code should be: the Round Number + Your Event + Your Assigned Room Number (e.g., Round 1 in LD in Room 12 = “1LD12”).

- Audio and video recordings of the rounds are prohibited. NO ONE (neither competitors nor judges) may record rounds.

### Competitors

- Forfeit time is 10 minutes after the Round is set to start.
- If you are not in your room - you will forfeit the round.
- Just a Reminder: The use of computers, electronic storage, and retrieval devices, etc., is allowed in LD Rounds.
  - Connectivity to any persons other than the competitors or judges in the round is not allowed. Competitors violating this rule will be disqualified from the competition.

### Judges

- For Lincoln-Douglas - there are three (3) judges per round (5 in Semis and Finals).
  - Please wait for all judges before the round begins.
- We are very tight on judges - so please plan to judge all 5 rounds (10 flights) on Saturday.
- If you are assigned a round: push “{{button}}” to acknowledge the ballot as soon as you are in the room and able. If it is a double flighted round, press the {{button}} (formerly known as the "Start Button") for the A flight ballot.
- If you are not assigned a round: report to the Judge Lounge and wait until you have been released by the TAB Room Staff. You will be released when all rounds have started.
- We may need to ask you to substitute for a missing judge, so it is critical that you report to and remain in the Judge Lounge if you are not scheduled for a round.
- **You can be fined for not reporting to your room on time**. If the TAB Room has to substitute a new/different judge for your assigned round, you will be fined.

## Schedule

## Judge Notes and Expectations

Judges not assigned a round are on standby and must be in the Judges Lounge when rounds are posted for possible substitutions.

We are very tight on judges, so please be prepared to judge all five rounds (10 flights) on Saturday.

Note: if you are on standby for consecutive preliminary rounds, there might be a problem, and you should notify Tabroom. This is especially true this year, given how tight we are on judges.

**ONLY THE ASSIGNED JUDGE MAY JUDGE. YOU MAY NOT (NEVER EVER) ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO JUDGE IN YOUR NAME. YOU MAY NOT FIND A SUBSTITUTE JUDGE.**

### Before Each Round

- Once you receive your round assignment, click “{{button}}” on your A-Flight ballot.
- Please report to the room ASAP and no later than ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time if possible.

### Prep Time

- Lincoln-Douglas = 4 minutes

### During Rounds

- Flow (take notes)
- Keep time (NOTE: Students will likely time themselves as well, which is perfectly acceptable.)
- Enter comments on your Ballot on Tabroom.com between speeches or during prep time.
- A good judge is a silent judge. The only communication a judge should have with the competitors is to assist the orderly flow of the round. Do not ask questions, do not comment on arguments, and do not get involved in the debate in any way.
- Judges are **not** permitted to disclose or discuss the round with the competitors due to time constraints. Feedback is indeed highly valued and essential, so please convey as much as possible to the competitors via the Ballot, not during the tournament.
- Judges are **not** permitted to confer with each other on the decision.
- If a student chooses to wear a mask during a round, Judges should not comment on that (during the round or on the ballot) and should not deduct speaker points.

### After Rounds

- Quickly read any contested evidence you have not already reviewed that is crucial to your decision.
- Confirm (verbally) that the sides listed on your ballots are correct.
- Enter points (following the scale below) and a decision (there must be one winner and one loser).
  - We are using tenths of points
  - Points cannot be tied
  - There are NO low point wins
- Confirm your decision in Tabroom.com.
- Write the winning SCHOOL and SIDE in your RFD on the Ballot. This helps the Tabroom ensure your decision is recorded correctly.
- Please stay in your room until your decision is submitted.
- Help debaters and coaches by explaining on the Ballot the argument that caused you to vote the way you did (remember, **NO oral critique & NO disclosure**)
- Please provide a reason for your decision on the Ballot so the debaters can improve their arguments and debate skills in the future!
- If you need, you can complete comments later:
  - For Lincoln-Douglas - all comments for Rounds 1-5 must be entered by 8:00 pm on Saturday, May 29, 2021. For Elimination Rounds, please work to have all comments for each Elimination Round on the ballot within 20 minutes of the round ending.

### Debate speaker point scale

Speaker points are used to give a holistic measurement of the effectiveness of the debater’s participation in the round - speaking, strategy, decorum, etc. Judges must follow the speaker point scale, regardless of what they are used to or may prefer so that there is a fair standard across all rounds. Plus, if we have a standard, points provide meaningful feedback instead of being arbitrary and useless!

**Low Point Wins are NOT Allowed in Lincoln-Douglas**

|           | SPEAKER POINT GUIDE                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 29.5‑30   | I wish I could frame your speeches – hard to imagine a better speaker     |
| 29.1‑29.4 | you were consistently excellent                                           |
| 28.8‑29.0 | you were effective and strategic, and made only minor mistakes            |
| 28.3‑28.7 | you hit all the right notes, but could improve (e.g. depth or efficiency) |
| 27.8‑28.2 | you mainly did the right thing, but left something to be desired          |
| 27.3‑27.7 | you missed major things and were hard to follow                           |
| 27.0‑27.2 | you advanced little in the debate or cost your team the round             |
| 26.0‑26.9 | you are not ready for this division/tournament                            |
| Below 26  | you were offensive, ignorant, rude, or tried to cheat (MUST come to tab)  |

### Forfeits

**ONLY The TAB Room declares and enters forfeits.** If you think a team should be forfeited, you must talk to the TAB Room. You may not enter that result on your own.

### Rules Violations

Please consult the TAB Room before deciding that something in the round warrants punishment for violating the rules.

## Event Rules

### Coin Flips - Round 5 and Elimination Rounds

Following current NCFL rules, sides are set by the TAB Room. There are no coin flips in prelims until Round 5 and then in elimination rounds. In elims, unless opponents have met previously, the round begins with a coin flip. The winner of the flip may choose the side on which they want to compete.

In Lincoln-Douglas the affirmative will always speak first.

NSDA Campus/Tabroom.com **will** manage the coin flip. Five minutes after a pairing is released, the teams will be notified who won the flip, enabling that team to make their selection. **Debaters must check their email for the Tabroom.com link!** If they miss their chance, the other team will be given the choice.

### Structure of a Round

The structure of a round is not modifiable, with the exception that speakers are not required to use all of their speech or prep time. That time is simply absorbed, not transferred to other activities.

Lincoln-Douglas:

| Time     | Speech                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| 6 minute | Affirmative Constructive         |
| 3 minute | Cross-examination by negative    |
| 7 minute | Negative Constructive            |
| 3 minute | Cross-examination by affirmative |
| 4 minute | Affirmative Rebuttal             |
| 6 minute | Negative Rebuttal                |
| 3 minute | Affirmative Rebuttal             |

4 minutes of Prep Time per side

### Calling for and sharing evidence

**All Debate Events**: the NCFL’s Rules of Evidence, Article II, Section C, Paragraph 5, Subparagraph (e) - Debate Judge Procedures:

> “Judges may read any materials in any speech, including reading while the debate is in progress. All decisions must be submitted within 55 minutes of the start time of LD and PF flights, and within one hour and fifty minutes of the start time of Policy CX rounds. The reading of complete citations is required only when requested by the opponent.”

For Lincoln Douglas Debate, the Affirmative team should create a Room on <https://speechdrop.net/> as soon as they enter the room and share the SpeechDrop Room Number with everyone in the round through the Chat feature for evidence sharing during the round.

The Room Code should be: the Round Number + Your Event + Your Assigned Room Number (e.g., Round 1 in LD in Room 12 = “1LD12”).

In Lincoln-Douglas, any evidence read/cited in the round must be made available to the opponent upon request. Requests for evidence, and the time spent finding the evidence, is untimed in the round and MAY NOT be used for prep time for any debater. Teams ought to be able to find and electronically share their evidence very, very rapidly. If the time spent finding a piece of evidence is excessive, you may begin running prep time - however, the lack of prep time CANNOT be a reason to deny a team the chance to see their opponent’s evidence.

Time spent reading the opponent’s evidence must be timed in some way, either as prep time or while another speech/crossfire is underway.

### Evidence Challenges

In Lincoln-Douglas the quality of evidence may be a part of the debate. Below are some ways you could consider evidence issues:

1. Per the Bylaws, Judges MUST read complete citations ONLY if requested by the opponent.
1. If a debater/team claims evidence is of low quality, from a disreputable source, uses a flawed methodology, etc. - you could decide this issue in the course of the debate based on the arguments made by the teams. You can also read the evidence if you would like.
1. If a debater/team cannot produce evidence they read when requested by their opponent- you could disregard the evidence in your decision if you like.
1. If a debater/team alleges that their opponent’s evidence is fabricated - you can request to review the evidence and decide how it impacts your decision.

You can consult the TAB Room for help resolving these issues, but we cannot make the decision for you.
