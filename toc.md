### Important Notes

- Saturday rounds are DOUBLE-flighted.
  - Because the Coin Flip is pre-set to occur a specific time in each Flight we cannot start B-flight early in Round 5.
  - Judges = If you do NOT have both A-flight debaters, but you do have both B-flight debaters, you can let the B-flight debaters go first
  - However: DO NOT MIX AND MATCH
    - A-flight debaters MUST debate each other
    - B-flight debaters MUST debate each other
  - Judges = ONCE the first flight is done - move immediately to the next flight
  - Students = A-Flight should go to the floor immediately once Round 5 is posted!
  - All kids should go to the floor (A-flight + B-flight) prior to Round Start and those not debating go back to the Student Lounge once the Round Starts
- Judges = Do NOT disclose your decision or provide oral critique - the decision and all comments go on the ballot.
- Judges = Do NOT confer with the other judges in the round.
- ALL = There is Wi-Fi - but please Do NOT stream music or video on the Wi-Fi or otherwise use it for personal activities. We need the Wi-Fi for rounds to run smoothly, ballots to be submitted, and the tournament to run on time!
- All = You will find 2 plugs in each cubicle. Please remember to bring a powerstrip to ensure everyone in the round can access power.

### How It Works

- Judges = once Pairings are posted, as soon as possible: (1) get to your room; and (2) access your ballot by hitting the “ON MY WAY” button (formerly known as “Start”) on the A-flight ballot immediately.
  - If you end up running the B-flight first - that’s ok. You can click ON MY WAY on the B-flight ballot and Tabroom can unstart A-flight for you. You can then click ON MY WAY on the A-flight ballot once you run that flight.
  - We want judges to press the ON MY WAY (formerly known as the "Start Button") on the A-flight ballot as soon as possible so we know you are here and we do not need to find a substitute!
- Judges = to be very clear: do not wait for the beginning of the A-flight debate to press the ON MY WAY (formerly known as the "Start Button") . Press ON MY WAY on the A-flight ballot the moment you are on your way.
  Reminder: competitors will forfeit their Round if they are not in the competition room 10 mins after the Round is posted to start.
- Judges - if you need a forfeit declared - Contact Tab!! You cannot declare the forfeit. Only the Tab Chair can declare a forfeit.

- Evidence Sharing = If you want to share evidence online, the Affirmative team should create a Room on <https://speechdrop.net/> as soon as they enter the room and share the SpeechDrop Room Number with everyone in the round
  The Room Code should be: the Round Number + Your Event + Your Assigned Room Number (e.g., Round 1 in LD in Room 12 = “1LD12”).

- Audio and video recordings of the rounds are prohibited. NO ONE (neither competitors nor judges) may record rounds.

### Competitors

- Forfeit time is 10 minutes after the Round is set to start.
- If you are not in your room - you will forfeit the round.
- Just a Reminder: The use of computers, electronic storage, and retrieval devices, etc., is allowed in LD Rounds.
  - Connectivity to any persons other than the competitors or judges in the round is not allowed. Competitors violating this rule will be disqualified from the competition.

### Judges

- For Lincoln-Douglas - there are three (3) judges per round (5 in Semis and Finals).
  - Please wait for all judges before the round begins.
- We are very tight on judges - so please plan to judge all 5 rounds (10 flights) on Saturday.
- If you are assigned a round: push “ON MY WAY” to acknowledge the ballot as soon as you are in the room and able. If it is a double flighted round, press the ON MY WAY (formerly known as the "Start Button") for the A flight ballot.
- If you are not assigned a round: report to the Judge Lounge and wait until you have been released by the TAB Room Staff. You will be released when all rounds have started.
- We may need to ask you to substitute for a missing judge, so it is critical that you report to and remain in the Judge Lounge if you are not scheduled for a round.
- **You can be fined for not reporting to your room on time**. If the TAB Room has to substitute a new/different judge for your assigned round, you will be fined.

## Schedule

## Judge Notes and Expectations

Judges not assigned a round are on standby and must be in the Judges Lounge when rounds are posted for possible substitutions.

We are very tight on judges, so please be prepared to judge all five rounds (10 flights) on Saturday.

Note: if you are on standby for consecutive preliminary rounds, there might be a problem, and you should notify Tabroom. This is especially true this year, given how tight we are on judges.

**ONLY THE ASSIGNED JUDGE MAY JUDGE. YOU MAY NOT (NEVER EVER) ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO JUDGE IN YOUR NAME. YOU MAY NOT FIND A SUBSTITUTE JUDGE.**

### Before Each Round

- Once you receive your round assignment, click “ON MY WAY” on your A-Flight ballot.
- Please report to the room ASAP and no later than ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time if possible.

### Prep Time

- Lincoln-Douglas = 4 minutes

### During Rounds

- Flow (take notes)
- Keep time (NOTE: Students will likely time themselves as well, which is perfectly acceptable.)
- Enter comments on your Ballot on Tabroom.com between speeches or during prep time.
- A good judge is a silent judge. The only communication a judge should have with the competitors is to assist the orderly flow of the round. Do not ask questions, do not comment on arguments, and do not get involved in the debate in any way.
- Judges are **not** permitted to disclose or discuss the round with the competitors due to time constraints. Feedback is indeed highly valued and essential, so please convey as much as possible to the competitors via the Ballot, not during the tournament.
- Judges are **not** permitted to confer with each other on the decision.
- If a student chooses to wear a mask during a round, Judges should not comment on that (during the round or on the ballot) and should not deduct speaker points.

### After Rounds

- Quickly read any contested evidence you have not already reviewed that is crucial to your decision.
- Confirm (verbally) that the sides listed on your ballots are correct.
- Enter points (following the scale below) and a decision (there must be one winner and one loser).
  - We are using tenths of points
  - Points cannot be tied
  - There are NO low point wins
- Confirm your decision in Tabroom.com.
- Write the winning SCHOOL and SIDE in your RFD on the Ballot. This helps the Tabroom ensure your decision is recorded correctly.
- Please stay in your room until your decision is submitted.
- Help debaters and coaches by explaining on the Ballot the argument that caused you to vote the way you did (remember, **NO oral critique & NO disclosure**)
- Please provide a reason for your decision on the Ballot so the debaters can improve their arguments and debate skills in the future!
- If you need, you can complete comments later:
  - For Lincoln-Douglas - all comments for Rounds 1-5 must be entered by 8:00 pm on Saturday, May 29, 2021. For Elimination Rounds, please work to have all comments for each Elimination Round on the ballot within 20 minutes of the round ending.

### Debate speaker point scale

Speaker points are used to give a holistic measurement of the effectiveness of the debater’s participation in the round - speaking, strategy, decorum, etc. Judges must follow the speaker point scale, regardless of what they are used to or may prefer so that there is a fair standard across all rounds. Plus, if we have a standard, points provide meaningful feedback instead of being arbitrary and useless!

**Low Point Wins are NOT Allowed in Lincoln-Douglas**

|           | SPEAKER POINT GUIDE                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 29.5-30   | I wish I could frame your speeches – hard to imagine a better speaker     |
| 29.1-29.4 | you were consistently excellent                                           |
| 28.8-29.0 | you were effective and strategic, and made only minor mistakes            |
| 28.3-28.7 | you hit all the right notes, but could improve (e.g. depth or efficiency) |
| 27.8-28.2 | you mainly did the right thing, but left something to be desired          |
| 27.3-27.7 | you missed major things and were hard to follow                           |
| 27.0-27.2 | you advanced little in the debate or cost your team the round             |
| 26.0-26.9 | you are not ready for this division/tournament                            |
| Below 26  | you were offensive, ignorant, rude, or tried to cheat (MUST come to tab)  |

### Forfeits

**ONLY The TAB Room declares and enters forfeits.** If you think a team should be forfeited, you must talk to the TAB Room. You may not enter that result on your own.

### Rules Violations

Please consult the TAB Room before deciding that something in the round warrants punishment for violating the rules.

## Event Rules

### Coin Flips - Round 5 and Elimination Rounds

Following current NCFL rules, sides are set by the TAB Room. There are no coin flips in prelims until Round 5 and then in elimination rounds. In elims, unless opponents have met previously, the round begins with a coin flip. The winner of the flip may choose the side on which they want to compete.

In Lincoln-Douglas the affirmative will always speak first.

NSDA Campus/Tabroom.com **will** manage the coin flip. Five minutes after a pairing is released, the teams will be notified who won the flip, enabling that team to make their selection. **Debaters must check their email for the Tabroom.com link!** If they miss their chance, the other team will be given the choice.

### Structure of a Round

The structure of a round is not modifiable, with the exception that speakers are not required to use all of their speech or prep time. That time is simply absorbed, not transferred to other activities.

Lincoln-Douglas:

|          |                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| 6 minute | Affirmative Constructive         |
| 3 minute | Cross-examination by negative    |
| 7 minute | Negative Constructive            |
| 3 minute | Cross-examination by affirmative |
| 4 minute | Affirmative Rebuttal             |
| 6 minute | Negative Rebuttal                |
| 3 minute | Affirmative Rebuttal             |

4 minutes of Prep Time per side

### Calling for and sharing evidence

**All Debate Events**: the NCFL’s Rules of Evidence, Article II, Section C, Paragraph 5, Subparagraph (e) - Debate Judge Procedures:

> “Judges may read any materials in any speech, including reading while the debate is in progress. All decisions must be submitted within 55 minutes of the start time of LD and PF flights, and within one hour and fifty minutes of the start time of Policy CX rounds. The reading of complete citations is required only when requested by the opponent.”

For Lincoln Douglas Debate, the Affirmative team should create a Room on <https://speechdrop.net/> as soon as they enter the room and share the SpeechDrop Room Number with everyone in the round through the Chat feature for evidence sharing during the round.

The Room Code should be: the Round Number + Your Event + Your Assigned Room Number (e.g., Round 1 in LD in Room 12 = “1LD12”).

In Lincoln-Douglas, any evidence read/cited in the round must be made available to the opponent upon request. Requests for evidence, and the time spent finding the evidence, is untimed in the round and MAY NOT be used for prep time for any debater. Teams ought to be able to find and electronically share their evidence very, very rapidly. If the time spent finding a piece of evidence is excessive, you may begin running prep time - however, the lack of prep time CANNOT be a reason to deny a team the chance to see their opponent’s evidence.

Time spent reading the opponent’s evidence must be timed in some way, either as prep time or while another speech/crossfire is underway.

### Evidence Challenges

In Lincoln-Douglas the quality of evidence may be a part of the debate. Below are some ways you could consider evidence issues:

1. Per the Bylaws, Judges MUST read complete citations ONLY if requested by the opponent.
1. If a debater/team claims evidence is of low quality, from a disreputable source, uses a flawed methodology, etc. - you could decide this issue in the course of the debate based on the arguments made by the teams. You can also read the evidence if you would like.
1. If a debater/team cannot produce evidence they read when requested by their opponent- you could disregard the evidence in your decision if you like.
1. If a debater/team alleges that their opponent’s evidence is fabricated - you can request to review the evidence and decide how it impacts your decision.

You can consult the TAB Room for help resolving these issues, but we cannot make the decision for you.

# Speech
## Contact Information
## Announcements / Updates
## Wireless Information
## Round Procedures
### Competitors

- Report to your room 10 minutes prior to round start time.
- If you arrive late or need to leave early, please do not enter/leave while another student is speaking. Wait until you hear the applause before entering/exiting the room.
- Speakers may choose to wear their mask(s) during their presentation. They should not be penalized for this, and there should be no comments on the ballot about their choice.
- Speakers may choose to exit the room after their presentation instead of sitting in the room with the others.
- Please give all competitors your undivided attention. Please no texting or other cell phone activities during the round. Be sure to applaud every speaker in the room.

### Before Each Round

- Once you receive a round assignment and are at your room, click “START” on your ballot. _To be very clear: do not wait for the beginning of the round to press the START button. Press start on the ballot the moment you are set up in the room._
- Please report to the room ASAP and no later than **ten minutes** prior to the scheduled start time if possible.
- You do not need every student present in order to start the round. If you are missing students or judges in your room 10 mins after the posted start time - please contact us!
  - TEXT ONLY TO 202-599-9020. Include in your Text:
    - The Room No. you are in AND
    - Your Issue -
    - If missing a competitor - type in Missing + Competitor Code
    - If missing a judge - type in Missing + Judge Code
- If a student arrives late, have them speak in the closest position to their initial speaker order on the ballot.
- **NO OBSERVERS:** if a person in the room is not a judge or a speaker, please remind them that all prelim, octafinal, and quarterfinal rounds are not open to observers. Observers are welcome to attend semifinal and final rounds per space availability. This includes any family members of judges or competitors.

### During Rounds

- Take notes DURING the performance. You can type, the students are used to it! Do not wait until after each student to write your comments.
  Keep time. Please provide time signals per the student’s request. If time signals are requested and not provided as promised, DO NOT penalize the student if they perform over the grace period of 30 seconds.
- Record your comments using a ‘hard drive’ program (Word, Notepad, Pages). If the internet becomes unstable in your room or building, you might lose all your comments otherwise.
- A good judge is a friendly judge - but a quiet judge. The only communication a judge should have with the competitors is to assist the orderly flow of the round. Avoid any extraneous conversation, especially concerning students’ names, schools, hometowns, or other personal information. Friendly ‘hellos’ and a generic, round-wide ‘great job, everyone!’ or ‘thank you, everybody!’ are perfectly fine.
  Remember, with the masks, students cannot see your facial expressions and encouraging smiles while they are performing. Be sure to nod approvingly and lead the applause in the room.
- Judges are not permitted to disclose their ranks with any person (including the competitors) or discuss specific performances from the round with any person (including the competitors) until after the tournament.
- Judges are not permitted to confer with each other on the decision.
- If a student chooses to wear a mask during a round, Judges should not comment on that (during the round or on the ballot).
- Speakers may choose to exit the room after their presentation instead of sitting in the room with the others. Again, there should be no penalty or comments made with respect to their choice.

### After Rounds

- Enter your ranks as soon as the round is over.
- Confirm your decision in Tabroom.com. Remember, the order of speakers will change to convey the incremental ranking (1st through 6th place). Please double-check that each speaker is ranked correctly.
- Copy/Paste your comments into Tabroom.com and hit ‘SAVE’ periodically. If you need assistance, click here.
- Please provide any general feedback in the Reason-For-Decision window (RFD) regarding the round. You might include what affected your top 3 decisions vs. your bottom 3 decisions. This is NOT the window for individual student feedback.
- Provide speaker-specific commentary in the appropriate window for each speaker. Please review your comments to ensure they cannot be misread or misunderstood. Please remember the information regarding equity and implicit biases when writing your ballots.
- If you need, you can complete comments later; however, try to have comments entered within 2 hours of the end of rounds.
- For Speech - all comments for Rounds 1-4 must be entered by 6:30 pm on Saturday. For Elimination Rounds, please work to have all comments for each Elimination Round on the ballot within 30 minutes of the round ending.

## Schedule

## Judge Notes and Expectations

### Judge Training

### Rule Violations & Protest Procedures

Please consult the TAB Room (202-599-9020) before deciding that something in the round warrants a reduction in rank. Beyond going over the grace period on time, do not penalize a student for a rule infraction until you have discussed the matter with TAB. If you think a speaker should be disqualified, you must talk to the PROTEST committee. You cannot make that decision on your own.

#### Protest Procedures

If someone has a question regarding a protest, they can either contact the Speech Tab Room directly, through the text line at 202-599-9020, or contact the Tournament Help Desk at:

- Visit the Help Desk Zoom Room (Passcode NCFL)
- Email the help desk at ncflhelpdesk@gmail.com
- Text the help desk at 413-367-6235
- Per NCFL bylaws, only a coach or a judge may submit a protest.
- If a protest is warranted, a member of the Protest team will speak with that person to determine if it is a judge’s preference issue or a true protest.
- If it is a Judge’s Preference issue, judges will be instructed that they can weigh the issue and rank the speakers as they deem appropriate.
- If there is a protest to be filed, judges will be asked to fill out the Protest Form. The form link will be provided by the protest team member.
- The usual procedures will be in place regarding a protest as described in our bylaws.
