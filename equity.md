## NCFL Harassment & Discrimination Policy
The National Catholic Forensic League (NCFL) is committed to providing participants, judges, coaches, and volunteers the opportunity to pursue excellence in their endeavors. This opportunity can exist only when each member of our community is assured an atmosphere of mutual respect. The NCFL prohibits all forms of harassment and discrimination. Accordingly, all forms of harassment and discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by any applicable federal, state, or local law are prohibited, whether committed by participants, judges, coaches, volunteers, and/or observers. The NCFL reserves all rights to subject violators to the full range of sanctions, up to and including removal from the tournament premises and referral to appropriate authorities. Any individual or group of individuals who believe they have been a victim of harassment and/or discrimination should report it to an Equity Advocate or appropriate authority immediately.

* Any tournament participant, including students, coaches, judges, and observers, who believe they have been the subject of harassment and/or discrimination in violation of the NCFL Harassment and Discrimination policy are encouraged to contact an equity advocate and report the alleged violation.
* Please note: Equity Complaints should be brought to the committee if someone feels they have faced discrimination or harassment, while Rules Protests should be filed if someone is in violation of competitive event rules.
