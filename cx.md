## Round Procedures

### How It Works

- Once Pairings are posted, judges should immediately access your ballot by
  hitting the “{{button}}” button
- Everyone (competitors and judges) should be in competition rooms no later
  than 10 minutes before the round is scheduled to start. Contact tab if anyone
  is missing at start time
- Evidence Sharing: Students should be prepared to share, electronically or by
  paper, any evidence they read in the round with their opponent and the judge.
  If you want to share evidence online, it should be done using
  <https://share.tabroom.com/>. A link to the sharing space for the round will
  be sent to each debater through the pairing

### Judges

- There are three (3) judges per round (5 in Semis and Finals). Please wait for
  all judges before the round begins.
- If you are assigned a round: push “{{button}}” to acknowledge the ballot as
  soon as you receive the ballot.
- If you are not assigned a round: report to the event judge lounge 
  and wait until the TAB Room has released you. You will be released when all
  rounds have started. We may need to ask you to substitute for a missing
  judge, so it is critical that you report to and remain in the judge lounge if
  you are not scheduled for a round.
- You can be fined for not reporting to your room on time. If the TAB Room has
  to substitute a new/different judge for your assigned round, you will be
  fined.

## Judge Notes and Expectations

Judges who are not assigned a round are on standby and must be in the judges
lounge when rounds are posted for possible substitutions.

### Before Rounds

- If you received a blast message for your round assignment:
  - PLEASE CLICK “{{button}}” TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE BALLOT. Tab
    staff will check all rooms, so do not wait until starting to click start.
  - ONLY THE ASSIGNED JUDGE MAY JUDGE. YOU MAY NOT (NEVER EVER) ALLOW SOMEONE
    ELSE TO JUDGE IN YOUR NAME. ONLY THE TABROOM CAN CHANGE A JUDGE.
- Once you are in your room:
  - If debaters are missing at In Room Time, text or email tab or tell a member
    of tab staff
  - Do not start without three adults looking at ballots that all say the same
    sides that the debaters think they are on!
- If you did NOT receive a blast message for your round assignment:
  - Double-check the pairings to be sure you are unassigned!
  - Judges who are not assigned a round are on standby and must be in the
    judges’ lounge at In Room Time for possible substitutions.

### During Rounds

- Flow (take notes)
- Keep time
- Enter comments on tabroom between speeches or during prep time
- That’s it. Do not ask questions, answer questions, comment on arguments, or get involved in the debate in any way

### After Rounds

- Quickly read any evidence that is crucial to making your decision.
- Confirm (verbally) that the sides listed on your ballot are correct.
- DO NOT CONFER WITH OTHER JUDGES except to confirm that sides are correct.
  Judges must decide the winner independently.
- Enter points (following the scale; see ballot and below) and a decision (must
  be one winner and one loser).
- Confirm decision in tabroom. Write the winning SCHOOL and SIDE in your RFD.
  Help debaters and coaches by explaining the argument that caused you to vote.
- DISCLOSURE OF DECISIONS IS NOT ALLOWED FOR ANY REASON.
- Complete comments later - they remain open until the end of the tournament

### Rules Violations

Please consult TAB before deciding that something in the round warrants
punishment for violating the rules, excepting the evidence violation process
described below.

### Decision Timer

- Judges have 110 minutes from the ROUND START TIME (not when you click start,
  not when you really start, but the scheduled start time) to submit their
  decisions. This countdown is visible on the ballot. This rule exists a) to
  keep us on schedule, b) to encourage debaters to minimize wasted time within
  rounds, and c) to prevent judges from overanalyzing every piece of evidence
  in a round.
- This should create an incentive for all participants to start on time (or
  early!), move swiftly through the round, and quickly notify tab of any tech
  issues or missing persons. It may NOT be used to justify cutting time from
  speeches, crossfires, prep, or tech time.
- Judges who have not decided by the decision deadline will be visited by
  grumpy Tab staff. The ballot does not disappear when the timer ends - even if
  you exceed the time allotted, finish the round and vote as normal!
- Remember that the decision timer is for points and the winner. You can always
  go back and enter more comments until the end of the tournament!

### Obligations

- Judges are obligated for all preliminary rounds. Elimination round
  obligations are set by the diocese and determined before the tournament. Tab
  will not change assignments, except if you are volunteering for extra rounds!
- Note that first year out judges cannot judge elimination debates under any
  circumstances. If you are a 2022 high school graduate assigned to elimination
  round pools, find a willing substitute from your diocese or your diocese will
  be fined - and make this change with the Tabroom Staff before prelims end on 
  Saturday.

## Event Rules

### Coin Flips

- In Rounds 1-4, sides are assigned by tabroom. In Round 5, and in Elims
  (unless opponents have met previously), the round begins with a coin flip.
  The winner of the flip may choose to affirm or negate. If the teams met in
  prelims, they will uphold the opposite side in elims.
- NSDA Campus/Tabroom.com will manage the coin flip. Five minutes after a
  pairing is released, the teams will be notified who won the flip, enabling
  that team to make their selection. Debaters must check their email for the
  tabroom link! If they fail to choose within 5 minutes, the other team will
  receive the choice.
- Missing the flip email, if it works for everyone else, is your problem. If a
  system-wide error occurs, judges will manage the flip in the room - tab will
  notify judges if this is necessary, judges may NOT flip unless notified by
  tab.

### Structure of a Round

| Speech                               | Time  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| 1st Affirmative Constructive         | 8 min |
| Cross-examination by 2nd Negative    | 3 min |
| 1st Negative Constructive            | 8 min |
| Cross-examination by 1st Affirmative | 3 min |
| 2nd Affirmative Constructive         | 8 min |
| Cross-examination by 1st Negative    | 3 min |
| 2nd Negative Constructive            | 8 min |
| Cross-examination by 2nd Affirmative | 3 min |
| 1st Negative Rebuttal                | 5 min |
| 1st Affirmative Rebuttal             | 5 min |
| 2nd Negative Rebuttal                | 5 min |
| 2nd Affirmative Rebuttal             | 5 min |

The structure of a round is not modifiable, with the exception that speakers
are not required to use all of their speech/crossfire time. That time is simply
absorbed, not transferred to other activities.

#### Prep time

8 minutes - teams may ask for prep time in between any two elements of the
round and may divide their prep time in any increments.

#### Calling for and sharing evidence

The NCFL’s Rules of Evidence, Article II, Section C, Paragraph 5, Subparagraph
(e) - Debate Judge Procedures:

> “Judges may read any materials in any speech, including reading while the
> debate is in progress. All decisions must be submitted within 55 minutes of
> the start time of LD and PF flights, and within one hour and fifty minutes of
> the start time of Policy CX rounds. The reading of complete citations is
> required only when requested by the opponent.”

Any evidence read/cited in the round must be made available to the opponent
upon request. Requests for evidence, and the time spent finding the evidence,
is untimed in the round and MAY NOT be used for prep time for any debater.
Teams ought to be able to find and electronically share their evidence very,
very rapidly. If the time spent finding a piece of evidence is excessive, the
judge may begin running prep time - however, the lack of prep time CANNOT be a
reason to deny a team the chance to see their opponent’s evidence.

### Evidence challenges

The quality of evidence may be a part of the debate. In fact, good debaters
make evidence comparisons. Here is a way to consider the escalation of evidence
issues:

- A team claims evidence is of low quality, from a disreputable source, uses a
  flawed methodology, etc. - decide this issue in the course of the debate
  based on the arguments made by the teams. Read the evidence after the debate
  if you’d like.
- A team cannot produce evidence they read - disregard the evidence in your
  decision and pretend it was never mentioned
- If a debater/team alleges that their opponent’s evidence is fabricated - you
  can request to review the evidence and decide how it impacts your decision.
- A team alleges that their opponent’s evidence is fabricated - this claim
  would, under NSDA rules, stop the round for the judge to determine win/loss
  in the debate based solely on the evidence challenge. Please confirm that
  this is a team’s intent before stopping the debate.

You can consult tab for help resolving these issues, but we cannot make the decision for you.

### Debate Speaker Point Scale

Speaker points are used to give a holistic measurement of the effectiveness of
the debater’s participation in the round - speaking, strategy, decorum, etc.
Judges must follow the speaker point scale, regardless of what they are used to
or may prefer, so that there is a fair standard across all rounds. Plus, if we
have a standard, points provide meaningful feedback instead of being arbitrary
and useless!

| Points    | Meaning                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 29.5‑30   | I wish I could frame your speeches – hard to imagine a better speaker     |
| 29.1‑29.4 | you were consistently excellent                                           |
| 28.8‑29.0 | you were effective and strategic, and made only minor mistakes            |
| 28.3‑28.7 | you hit all the right notes, but could improve (e.g. depth or efficiency) |
| 27.8‑28.2 | you mainly did the right thing, but left something to be desired          |
| 27.3‑27.7 | you missed major things and were hard to follow                           |
| 27.0‑27.2 | you advanced little in the debate or cost your team the round             |
| 26.0‑26.9 | you are not ready for this division/tournament                            |
| Below 26  | you were offensive, ignorant, rude, or tried to cheat (MUST come to tab)  |

Low-point wins (where the winning team has fewer points than the losing team) are allowed.|

### No mavericks allowed

Policy Debate is a team event. Both partners must participate in each debate or
they will forfeit the round.
