## Round Procedures

### Competitors

- Report to your room 10 minutes prior to round start time.
- If you arrive late or need to leave early, please do not enter/leave while
  another student is speaking. Wait until you hear the applause before
  entering/exiting the room.
- Speakers may choose to wear their mask(s) during their presentation. They
  should not be penalized for this, and there should be no comments on the
  ballot about their choice.
- Speakers may choose to exit the room after their presentation instead of
  sitting in the room with the others.
- Please give all competitors your undivided attention. Please no texting or
  other cell phone activities during the round. Be sure to applaud every
  speaker in the room.

### Judges

#### Before Each Round

- Once you receive a round assignment, please note the time and plan to arrive in the room 10 minutes prior to the start time. Please hit the "In the room" button once you have arrived in the room.
- Do not begin the round until you have confirmed all three judges are present.  (Do not assume another adult in the room is a judge.)  Checkers will be checking rooms and will report missing judges to the tab room.  Please only text about a missing judge if a checker has not been to your room 15 minutes after the round was scheduled to begin.  We will send the checker to the room to help replace the judge.
- You do not need every student present in order to start the round. If you are
  missing students in your room **30 mins after** the posted start time -
  please contact us!
    - TEXT ONLY TO {{speech_phone}}. Include in your Text:
        - The Room Number you are in AND
        - Your Issue -
        - If missing a competitor - type in Missing + Competitor Code
- If a student arrives late, have them speak in the closest position to their
  initial speaker order on the ballot.
- Observers are allowed in Saturday rounds ONLY with the permission of ALL
  Competitors & Judges in the Room. Anyone can say NO without penalty or
  prejudice.
- Observers are allowed in Sunday rounds without any special permission subject
  to the room's capacity. 
- All observers must be seated. If you are still
  competing you CANNOT observe rounds in your event until you are eliminated

#### During Rounds

- Take notes DURING the performance. You can type, the students are used to it!
  Do not wait until after each student to write your comments. Keep time.
  Please provide time signals per the student’s request. If time signals are
  requested and not provided as promised, DO NOT penalize the student if they
  perform over the grace period of 30 seconds.
- Record your comments using a ‘hard drive’ program (Word, Notepad, Pages). If
  the internet becomes unstable in your room or building, you might lose all
  your comments otherwise.
- A good judge is a friendly judge - but a quiet judge. The only communication
  a judge should have with the competitors is to assist the orderly flow of the
  round. Avoid any extraneous conversation, especially concerning students’
  names, schools, hometowns, or other personal information. Friendly ‘hellos’
  and a generic, round-wide ‘great job, everyone!’ or ‘thank you, everybody!’
  are perfectly fine.
- Judges are not permitted to disclose their ranks with any person (including
  the competitors) or discuss specific performances from the round with any
  person (including the competitors) until after the tournament.
- Judges are not permitted to confer with each other on the decision.
- If a student chooses to wear a mask during a round, Judges should not comment
  on that (during the round or on the ballot).
- Speakers may choose to exit the room after their presentation instead of
  sitting in the room with the others. Again, there should be no penalty or
  comments made with respect to their choice.

#### After Rounds

- Enter your ranks as soon as the round is over.
- Confirm your decision in Tabroom.com. Remember, the order of speakers will
  change to convey the incremental ranking (1st through 6th place). Please
  double-check that each speaker is ranked correctly.
- Copy/Paste your comments into Tabroom.com and hit ‘SAVE’ periodically. If you
  need assistance, see [these instructions](https://static.nycfl.tech/AStepbyStepGuidetoSpeechE-Balloting.pdf).
- Please provide any general feedback in the Reason-For-Decision window (RFD)
  regarding the round. You might include what affected your top 3 decisions vs.
  your bottom 3 decisions. This is NOT the window for individual student
  feedback.
- Provide speaker-specific commentary in the appropriate window for each
  speaker. Please review your comments to ensure they cannot be misread or
  misunderstood. Please remember the information regarding equity and implicit
  biases when writing your ballots.
- If you need, you can complete comments later; however, try to have comments
  entered within 2 hours of the end of rounds.
- For Speech - all comments for Rounds 1-4 must be entered by 6:30 pm on
  Saturday. For Elimination Rounds, please work to have all comments for each
  Elimination Round on the ballot within 30 minutes of the round ending.

## Judge Notes and Expectations

### Judge Training

See the Webinar recorded on Wednesday: LINK TBD

### Time Signals
- Keep time (All events are 10 minutes with 30-second grace except Extemp which is 7 minutes with a 30-second grace)
- Give whatever time signals speakers request - in Extemp it is EXPECTED that judges give time signals from 5 down. In all events, it is a sign of preparation, not lack of preparation, to ask for signals.  
- Before you penalize, please make sure you showed the speakers the requested time signals.  The mandated penalty for going overtime is that the student may not be ranked first.
- Examples of time signals can be found below:

![Illustration of time signals](./images/time-signals.png)


### Judge Reminder

Good judges make decisions only on what was presented by the contestants in the
round. The judges should distance themselves from the content of the
presentation. Personal values of the judges should not influence the decision.

### Rule Violations & Protest Procedures

Please consult the TAB Room ({{speech_phone}}) before deciding that something
in the round warrants a reduction in rank. Beyond going over the grace period
on time, do not penalize a student for a rule infraction until you have
discussed the matter with TAB. If you think a speaker should be disqualified,
you must talk to the PROTEST committee. You cannot make that decision on your
own.

#### Protest Procedures

If someone has a question regarding a protest, they can contact the
Speech Tab Room directly, through the text line at {{speech_phone}} or
[{{speech_email}}](email).

- Per NCFL bylaws, only a coach or a judge may submit a protest.
- If a protest is warranted, a member of the Protest team will speak with that
  person to determine if it is a judge’s preference issue or a true protest.
- If it is a Judge’s Preference issue, judges will be instructed that they can
  weigh the issue and rank the speakers as they deem appropriate.
- If there is a protest to be filed, judges will be asked to fill out the
  Protest Form. The form link will be provided by the protest team member.
- The usual procedures will be in place regarding a protest as described in our
  bylaws.

## Event Rules

### Dramatic Performance

  refers to prepared notes of any kind or a script during the presentation, the
  speaker will be disqualified.

  script, or single fictional or non-fictional work (not poetry). It is the

  altered for the presentation with the exception that cutting is permitted.

  sermons. Stand-up comedy routines are prohibited.
- The selection must be memorized. If the speaker refers to prepared notes of
  any kind or a script during the presentation, the speaker will be

- No particular style should be demanded of the speaker; rather, the contestant
  should be free to select and to develop a personal style and be judged
  according to the degree of perfection attained and the effectiveness in
  influencing the listeners. While the specifics of the speech and any style of
  delivery which the speaker adopts should be judged in light of the purpose of
  the speech, artificiality is to be discredited. This event is an
  interpretation, not an impersonation.
- This event is limited to freshman and sophomore students.
- No properties or costumes of any kind may be used. Using “properties” means
  manipulating articles of clothing or objects to enhance the performance.
  Speakers using properties and/or wearing costumes will be disqualified.
