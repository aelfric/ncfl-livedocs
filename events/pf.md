## Judge Notes and Expectations

Judges: thank you! Tournaments do not exist without you!

### Before the Tournament

- **Update your paradigm** debaters use judge paradigms to decide how to best adapt to the judge, so tell them what kind of debates you want to see! Be sure your paradigm is honest and accurate - your jokes are both not funny and not understood by people who don’t know you, which are the people who read your paradigm
- Please remove lines in your paradigm that incentivize non-debate behavior to earn speaker points. Speaker points matter and play a large role in determining who debates who and who reaches elimination rounds. The published speaker point scale that we use is designed to create consistency in points, which is also useful to debaters and coaches as they work to improve, learn, and grow. Please help us to help debaters know where they need to improve by using your speaker points only in consistent, educational ways.

### Before Rounds

- Move quickly to rounds – strive to be sitting down in round 10 minutes before
  round start time!
- If not scheduled - please wait in the judges’ lounge until “released.” ONLY
  THE ASSIGNED JUDGES MAY JUDGE THE DEBATE. YOU MAY NOT (NEVER EVER) ALLOW
  SOMEONE ELSE TO JUDGE IN YOUR NAME. YOU MAY NOT FIND A SUBSTITUTE JUDGE.
- If you are not scheduled and not used as replacement, do NOT observe other rounds

### During Rounds

- DO NOT MIX FLIGHTS!!! If you need to start Flight 2 first, fine, but be sure
  NOT to switch competitors. Confirm the teams and sides both before and after
  the round.
- For round 5:
    - Because the Coin Flip is pre-set to occur a specific time in each
      Flight we cannot start Flight 2 early in Round 5.
    - Students: Flight 1 should go to the floor immediately once Round 5 is
      posted!

### After Rounds

- Enter the winner and points on the ballot and Confirm the Ballot (unconfirmed
  ballots are not complete).
- Do NOT disclose the decision. Do this for the first flight before the second
  flight begins.
- RFDs should be given but kept short. There is no need to write an elaborately
  long ballot.
- Your comments are a wonderful way to help students and coaches get constructive, 
  productive, educational feedback. Please provide robust comments for all competitors.  
  Remember: you are more than just a judge this weekend: you’re an educator, too. 
- Additionally, and this is a new one this year, but as this has been an issue at other tournaments 
  throughout the country: please  write your comments yourself and do not use AI generators to do it for you. 
  These awesome kids took their time to create special presentations for you, so please take a few 
  moments to write some personal thoughts for them, too.

### Rules Violations

Please consult TAB before deciding that something in the round warrants
punishment for violating the rules, excepting the evidence violation process
described below.

1. Per the Bylaws, Debaters MUST read complete citations ONLY if requested by the
   opponent.
2. If a debater/team claims evidence is of low quality, from a disreputable
   source, uses a flawed methodology, etc. - you should decide this issue in the
   course of the debate based on the arguments made by the teams. You can also
   read the evidence if you would like.
3. If a debater/team cannot produce evidence they read when requested by their
   opponent - you can disregard the evidence in your decision if you like.
4. If a debater/team alleges that their opponent’s evidence is fabricated - you
   can request to review the evidence and decide how it impacts your decision.

You can consult the TAB Room for help resolving these issues, but we cannot
make the decision for you.

### Decision Timer

Judges have **55 minutes** for each flight from the ROUND START TIME (not when
you click start, not when you really start, but the scheduled start time) to
submit their decisions for each flight. This countdown is visible on the
ballot. This rule exists (a) to keep us on schedule, (b) to encourage debaters to
minimize wasted time within rounds, and (c) to prevent judges from over-analyzing
every piece of evidence in a round.

This should create an incentive for all participants to start on time (or
early!), move swiftly through the round, and quickly notify tab of any tech
issues or missing persons. It may NOT be used to justify cutting time from
speeches, crossfires, prep, or tech time.

Judges who have not voted by the decision deadline will be visited by a member
of the tab staff, unless we are aware of the tech issues that caused a delay.
The ballot does not disappear when the timer ends - even if you exceed the time
allotted, finish the round and vote as normal!

Remember that the decision timer is only for **points and the winner**. If you
find yourself approaching the end of the decision time, you can submit speaker
points and a decision without comments and re-visit your ballot throughout the
rest of the tournament to include your comments.

### Obligations

- Judges are obligated for all preliminary rounds. Elimination round
  obligations are set by the diocese and determined before the tournament. Tab
  will not change assignments, except if you are volunteering for extra rounds!

- Note that first year out judges cannot judge elimination debates under any
  circumstances. If you are a {{last_year}} high school graduate assigned to elimination
  round pools, find a willing substitute from your diocese or your diocese will
  be fined - and make this change with the Tabroom Staff on Saturday. For the
  purpose of this rule, the Play-In round counts as a prelim.

## Event Rules

### Coin Flips

**Please note** in NCFL, there is NO coin flip for sides or for speaker order.
There is only a coin flip for sides in Round 5 and in any elims when teams have
not met before. The coin flip is managed automatically in tabroom.com. Pro
always goes first.

### Debate Speaker Point Scale

Speaker points are used to give a holistic measurement of the effectiveness of the debater’s participation in the
round - speaking, strategy, decorum, etc. Judges must follow the speaker point scale, regardless of what they are used
to or may prefer, so that there is a fair standard across all rounds. Plus, if we have a standard, points provide
meaningful feedback instead of being arbitrary and useless!

| Points          | Meaning                                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 29.5&#8209;30   | I wish I could frame your speeches; your strategic decision-making belongs in a textbook |
| 29.1&#8209;29.4 | you were consistently excellent                                                          |
| 28.8&#8209;29.0 | you were effective and strategic, and made only minor mistakes                           |
| 28.3&#8209;28.7 | you hit all the right notes, but could improve (e.g. depth or efficiency)                |
| 27.8&#8209;28.2 | you mainly did the right thing, but left something to be desired                         |
| 27.3&#8209;27.7 | you missed major things and were hard to follow                                          |
| 27.0&#8209;27.2 | you advanced little in the debate or cost your team the round                            |
| 26.0&#8209;26.9 | you are not ready for this division/tournament                                           |
| Below 26        | you were offensive, ignorant, rude, or tried to cheat (Judge MUST come to tab)           |

For our common speaker point guide, you can think of the score as ignoring the 2 at the beginning and seeing the other two numbers as your grade on a normal 100-point scale. For example, a 29.8 is like a 98 grade, which is an A+, and a 27.1 is like a 71 grade, which is a C-.

#### Judge Reminder

Good judges make decisions only on what was debated by the contestants in the
round. The judges should distance themselves from the content of the debate.
Personal values of the judges should not influence the decision.
