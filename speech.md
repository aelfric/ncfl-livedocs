## Round Procedures

### Competitors

- Report to your room 10 minutes prior to round start time.
- If you arrive late or need to leave early, please do not enter/leave while another student is speaking. Wait until you hear the applause before entering/exiting the room.
- Speakers may choose to wear their mask(s) during their presentation. They should not be penalized for this, and there should be no comments on the ballot about their choice.
- Speakers may choose to exit the room after their presentation instead of sitting in the room with the others.
- Please give all competitors your undivided attention. Please no texting or other cell phone activities during the round. Be sure to applaud every speaker in the room.

### Before Each Round

- Once you receive a round assignment and are at your room, click “START” on your ballot. _To be very clear: do not wait for the beginning of the round to press the START button. Press start on the ballot the moment you are set up in the room._
- Please report to the room ASAP and no later than **ten minutes** prior to the scheduled start time if possible.
- You do not need every student present in order to start the round. If you are missing students or judges in your room 10 mins after the posted start time - please contact us!
  - TEXT ONLY TO 202-599-9020. Include in your Text:
    - The Room No. you are in AND
    - Your Issue -
    - If missing a competitor - type in Missing + Competitor Code
    - If missing a judge - type in Missing + Judge Code
- If a student arrives late, have them speak in the closest position to their initial speaker order on the ballot.
- **NO OBSERVERS:** if a person in the room is not a judge or a speaker, please remind them that all prelim, octafinal, and quarterfinal rounds are not open to observers. Observers are welcome to attend semifinal and final rounds per space availability. This includes any family members of judges or competitors.

### During Rounds

- Take notes DURING the performance. You can type, the students are used to it! Do not wait until after each student to write your comments.
  Keep time. Please provide time signals per the student’s request. If time signals are requested and not provided as promised, DO NOT penalize the student if they perform over the grace period of 30 seconds.
- Record your comments using a ‘hard drive’ program (Word, Notepad, Pages). If the internet becomes unstable in your room or building, you might lose all your comments otherwise.
- A good judge is a friendly judge - but a quiet judge. The only communication a judge should have with the competitors is to assist the orderly flow of the round. Avoid any extraneous conversation, especially concerning students’ names, schools, hometowns, or other personal information. Friendly ‘hellos’ and a generic, round-wide ‘great job, everyone!’ or ‘thank you, everybody!’ are perfectly fine.
  Remember, with the masks, students cannot see your facial expressions and encouraging smiles while they are performing. Be sure to nod approvingly and lead the applause in the room.
- Judges are not permitted to disclose their ranks with any person (including the competitors) or discuss specific performances from the round with any person (including the competitors) until after the tournament.
- Judges are not permitted to confer with each other on the decision.
- If a student chooses to wear a mask during a round, Judges should not comment on that (during the round or on the ballot).
- Speakers may choose to exit the room after their presentation instead of sitting in the room with the others. Again, there should be no penalty or comments made with respect to their choice.

### After Rounds

- Enter your ranks as soon as the round is over.
- Confirm your decision in Tabroom.com. Remember, the order of speakers will change to convey the incremental ranking (1st through 6th place). Please double-check that each speaker is ranked correctly.
- Copy/Paste your comments into Tabroom.com and hit ‘SAVE’ periodically. If you need assistance, click here.
- Please provide any general feedback in the Reason-For-Decision window (RFD) regarding the round. You might include what affected your top 3 decisions vs. your bottom 3 decisions. This is NOT the window for individual student feedback.
- Provide speaker-specific commentary in the appropriate window for each speaker. Please review your comments to ensure they cannot be misread or misunderstood. Please remember the information regarding equity and implicit biases when writing your ballots.
- If you need, you can complete comments later; however, try to have comments entered within 2 hours of the end of rounds.
- For Speech - all comments for Rounds 1-4 must be entered by 6:30 pm on Saturday. For Elimination Rounds, please work to have all comments for each Elimination Round on the ballot within 30 minutes of the round ending.

### Judge Training

### Rule Violations & Protest Procedures

Please consult the TAB Room (202-599-9020) before deciding that something in the round warrants a reduction in rank. Beyond going over the grace period on time, do not penalize a student for a rule infraction until you have discussed the matter with TAB. If you think a speaker should be disqualified, you must talk to the PROTEST committee. You cannot make that decision on your own.

#### Protest Procedures

If someone has a question regarding a protest, they can either contact the Speech Tab Room directly, through the text line at 202-599-9020, or contact the Tournament Help Desk at:

- Visit the Help Desk Zoom Room (Passcode NCFL)
- Email the help desk at <ncflhelpdesk@gmail.com>
- Text the help desk at 413-367-6235
- Per NCFL bylaws, only a coach or a judge may submit a protest.
- If a protest is warranted, a member of the Protest team will speak with that person to determine if it is a judge’s preference issue or a true protest.
- If it is a Judge’s Preference issue, judges will be instructed that they can weigh the issue and rank the speakers as they deem appropriate.
- If there is a protest to be filed, judges will be asked to fill out the Protest Form. The form link will be provided by the protest team member.
- The usual procedures will be in place regarding a protest as described in our bylaws.
