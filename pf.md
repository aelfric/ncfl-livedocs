## Schedule

## Judge Notes and Expectations

### Before Rounds

- Move quickly to rounds – strive to be sitting down in round 10 minutes before round start time!
- If not scheduled - please wait in the judges’ lounge until “released.”  ONLY THE ASSIGNED JUDGE MAY JUDGE THE DEBATE. YOU MAY NOT (NEVER EVER) ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO JUDGE IN YOUR NAME. YOU MAY NOT FIND A SUBSTITUTE JUDGE.
- If you are not scheduled and not used as replacement, do NOT observe other rounds

### During Rounds

- DO NOT MIX FLIGHTS!!!  If you need to start B flight first, fine, but be sure NOT to switch competitors.  Confirm the teams and sides both before and after the round.

### After Rounds

- Enter the winner and points on the ballot and Confirm the Ballot (unconfirmed ballots are not complete).  
- Do NOT disclose the decision.  Do this for the first flight before the second flight begins.
- RFDs should be given but kept short. There is no need to write an elaborately long ballot.

### Rules Violations

### Decision Timer

Judges have **55 minutes** for each flight from the ROUND START TIME (not when you click start, not when you really start, but the scheduled start time) to submit their decisions for each flight. This countdown is visible on the ballot. This rule exists a) to keep us on schedule, b) to encourage debaters to minimize wasted time within rounds, and c) to prevent judges from overanalyzing every piece of evidence in a round.

This should create an incentive for all participants to start on time (or early!), move swiftly through the round, and quickly notify tab of any tech issues or missing persons. It may NOT be used to justify cutting time from speeches, crossfires, prep, or tech time.

Judges who have not voted by the decision deadline will be visited by a member of the tab staff, unless we are aware of the tech issues that caused a delay. The ballot does not disappear when the timer ends - even if you exceed the time allotted, finish the round and vote as normal!

Remember that the decision timer is only for **points and the winner**. If you find yourself approaching the end of the decision time, you can submit speaker points and a decision without comments and re-visit your ballot throughout the rest of the tournament to include your comments.

### Obligations

## Event Rules

### Coin Flips

**Please note** in NCFL, there is NO coin flip for sides or for speaker order. There is only a coin flip for sides in Round 5 and in any elims when teams have not met before. Pro always goes first.

### Debate Speaker Point Scale

Speaker points are used to give a holistic measurement of the effectiveness of the debater’s participation in the round - speaking, strategy, decorum, etc. Judges must follow the speaker point scale, regardless of what they are used to or may prefer, so that there is a fair standard across all rounds. Plus, if we have a standard, points provide meaningful feedback instead of being arbitrary and useless!

| Points    | Meaning                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 29.5‑30   | I wish I could frame your speeches; your strategic decision-making belongs in a textbook |
| 29.1‑29.4 | you were consistently excellent                                                          |
| 28.8‑29.0 | you were effective and strategic, and made only minor mistakes                           |
| 28.3‑28.7 | you hit all the right notes, but could improve (e.g. depth or efficiency)                |
| 27.8‑28.2 | you mainly did the right thing, but left something to be desired                         |
| 27.3‑27.7 | you missed major things and were hard to follow                                          |
| 27.0‑27.2 | you advanced little in the debate or cost your team the round                            |
| 26.0‑26.9 | you are not ready for this division/tournament                                           |
| Below 26  | you were offensive, ignorant, rude, or tried to cheat (Judge MUST come to tab)           |
